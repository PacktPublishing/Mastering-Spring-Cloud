## About the Book
Developing, deploying, and operating cloud applications should be as easy as local applications. This should be the governing principle behind any cloud platform, library, or tool. Spring Cloud–an open-source library–makes it easy to develop JVM applications for the cloud. In this book, you will be introduced to Spring Cloud and will master its features from the application developer's point of view.
